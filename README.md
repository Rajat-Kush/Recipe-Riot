## 🎮 Game Overview

**Recipe Riot** is a fun and fast-paced cooking simulation game where you manage a kitchen, fulfill food orders, and serve them on time! As you progress, the orders become more frequent and challenging, testing your multitasking and time-management skills.

This project was developed as part of my Unity learning journey by following a tutorial presented on YouTube. While the core mechanics are based on the tutorial, I’ve polished and personalized several elements to enhance the experience.
